# Hello

This is an HTTP server I coded to start learning C++.

It works both as a webserver to deliver web pages and as a rest api server. Kinda. It's pretty flexible and can be pretty easily expandable.

This will definitly have mistakes and security vulnerabilities so please don't use it. Anyways it only works on localhost. Otherwise feel free to do what you want with it.

Ok bye!
